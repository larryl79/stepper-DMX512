# stepper-DMX512
Stepper motor control by DMX512

This code not by me, I just publicated it on github to find easier (and saved for myself too). I planning expand this code later to a lagre project.

How to Make DMX512 Fixture Using Arduino to Control the Stepper Motor | How to Build DMX512 Fixture

• This is a project demonstrating how to make  DMX512 Fixture Using Arduino to Control the Stepper Motor. We have controlled the Stepper motor position angle using the value on the DMX512 channel. In this fixture we can change the Channel number addressing using the simple DIP switches. 
DMX512 is a standard for digital communication networks that are commonly used to control stage lighting and effects. It was originally intended as a standardized method for controlling light dimmers.

DMX512 stands for digital multiplex 512.  This means that 512 channels are controlled digitally through 1 data cable. A channel is a set of 255 steps that are assigned to control attributes in each light.  This may be a color like red, green or blue, and intensity, strobe, pan/tilt or other attributes.
DMX512 is commonly used to control stage lighting and theatrical effects (ex: moving lights, color changing lights, fog machines, etc.) and also used for color changing LED applications

Different type of the fixtures are available in the market. But for some kind of special requirement we can make our own fixture. 
I was interested in controlling the angle of the stepper motor using the DMX channel value. For this specific purpose I have made my own DXM512 fixture.
